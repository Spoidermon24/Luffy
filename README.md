# Setting Up Macbook
Hereâ€™s a comprehensive guide that combines both the main steps and the detailed next steps:

### 1. **System Update**
   - **Check for macOS Updates**:

   - **Install Xcode Command Line Tools**:
     - Open Terminal and run:
       ```bash
       xcode-select --install
       ```
     - A pop-up will appear. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
     - Once installed, verify by running:
       ```bash
       gcc --version
       ```
     - You should see the version information for `gcc`, confirming the installation.

### 2. **Homebrew Installation**

       ```bash
       /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
       ```
   - **Add Homebrew to your PATH**:
     - The installation script typically suggests adding a line to your `.zprofile` or `.zshrc`. Follow the instructions, or manually add it:
       ```bash
       echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
       eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

       brew upgrade
       ```
   - **Check Installation**:
     - Verify the installation by running:
       ```bash
       brew doctor
       ```
     - This will check for any issues with your installation.
